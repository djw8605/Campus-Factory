	  obvious the things you have to change.

	* python-lib/campus_factory/ClusterStatus.py,
	  python-lib/campus_factory/Factory.py: Added better logging of

	  Ticket #1.

	* bin/runfactory, python-lib/campus_factory/ClusterStatus.py,
	  python-lib/campus_factory/Factory.py,
	  python-lib/campus_factory/Parsers.py: Added ability for
	  runfactory to stop, restart, and of course start the factory. If
	  no argument is given, it will start the factory.

	  argument was given.

	* python-lib/campus_factory/Factory.py: Changed the initialization
	  so that the restart and stop commands do not need the location of
	  the configuration to start/stop the factory.
